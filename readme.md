# EW Damage Numbers

This script displays damage next to entities that you have hurt.

## Commands

`/showhealth` | Show how much health a vehicle currently has.

`/hidehealth` | Turn off the current vehicle health overlay.

`/dmghud` | Display the HUD to change EWDN settings.

## TODO

The potential for a rewrite to JavaScript exists, and is at least partially done. Unfortunately, dataview is what is holding me back for the RedM portion of the rewrite.
